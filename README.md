# MtLebanonComputerClub
This is the general repo for info related to the new Mt. Lebanon Computer Science Club, or whatever it's called.

Feel free to edit as you please. I'd also like to see use in the wiki, but that's up for debate.

In other words, everything is up for changes and modifications.
