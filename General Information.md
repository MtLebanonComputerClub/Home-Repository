<h3 id="Purpose/Objective">Purpose/Objective</h3>

The Mt. Lebanon Computer Club was created to provide students who have an interest in computers with an opportunity to 
gather and share knowledge, collaborate on simple projects, and possibly assist the school Technology 

<h3 id="Meetings">Meetings</h3>

The Mt. Lebanon Computer Club meets every other week after school on Tuesdays.  During each meeting, members will have an
opportunity to gather and share information.  Members can share anything from a problem that has been troubling them to a 
new concept/idea they have learned.  Meetings are meant to be a time where members can ask/talk/present to most of the
group.  Work on club projects/individual projects must be done outside of these meetings.

<h3 id="Projects">Group/Individual Projects</h3>

The main purpose of the Mt. Lebanon Computer Club is to place students into groups of their similar skill level and task them
with a project to complete together.  Members are encouraged to create their own ideas, but all ideas must be
approved by the club coordinator before being worked on.  As mentioned above, projects are to be worked on outside of the
meetings as this time is reserved for members to gather and share progress/information.  Each project will be contained in 
the Mt. Lebanon Computer Club organization on GitHub.  After approval, project members will receive a repository for their
project, which they will use to host all the necessary files/resources/code for their project.

<h3 id="Guest Speakers">Guest Speakers</h3>

When possible, the Mt. Lebanon Computer Club will have guest speakers come in to talk about some part of the field.  
Examples include Google staff members, professors, and Bill Gates.  Since the guest speakers rarely have time after our 
school day, guest speakers will most likely come in earlier.  Members wanting to attend will receive a 2A form permitting
them to leave class in order to come.
