<h3 id="GitHub">How to GitHub</h3>

For purposes of version control, sync, and collaboration, we use the GitHub platform, which relies on a source code
revision program named [Git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git_(software)). Although git and GitHub's terminology
and workflow may seem confuising, the folks at GitHub offer a multitude of [guides](https://guides.github.com/) to get
you started. A few favorites:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/" target="_blank">Understanding the GitHub Flow</a></li>
<li><a href="https://guides.github.com/introduction/getting-your-project-on-github/" target="_blank">Getting your project on GitHub (the basics of using GitHub)</a></li>
<li><a href="https://guides.github.com/activities/contributing-to-open-source/#contributing" target="_blank">Contributing to Open Source</a></li>
</ul>
